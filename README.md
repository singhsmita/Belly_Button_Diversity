Belly Button Diversity
A Java Script HTML webpage and and visualization using Plotly.

Overview of Project
Purpose
Many bacteria are not well studied and many remain unknown to science.

Different types of bacteria in different parts of body harbor different species.Roza’s hypothesis suggests that ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef can be found in someone’s belly button .To test her hypothesis ,she has tested samples from many anonymous people across the country, who are identified by an ID number.

Results
The dashboard is accessible to both research participants as well as the fellow researchers to see what bacteria’s are found in each id number.
By selecting Test Subject ID number from the dropdown menu, the individual’s demographic information table and following three charts will dynamically response.
The horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species, will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.
The gauge chart displays the weekly washing frequency’s value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
The bubble chart displays bacteria culture test result for each sample
Dashboard Customization
Add an image to the jumbotron.
Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.
Add more information about the project as a paragraph on the page.
