### Purpose

Many bacteria are not well studied and many remain unknown to science.

Different types of bacteria in different parts of body harbor different species.Roza's hypothesis suggests that ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef can be found in someone's belly button .To test her hypothesis ,she has tested samples from many anonymous people across the country, who are identified by an ID number.


### Results
 - The dashboard is accessible to both research participants as well as the fellow researchers to see what bacteria's are found in each id number.
 - 
 - By selecting Test Subject ID number from the dropdown menu, the individual's demographic information table and following three charts will dynamically response.
 - The horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species, will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.
